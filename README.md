This repo contains all algorithms I'm learning and practising.
# Data structur
Data Types | Built-in | User defined 1 | USer defined 2 
:----:|:---:|:---:|:-----:
Integer | List | Stack | Queue
String | Tuple | Queue | -
Boolean | Set | Linked List | -
Float | Dictionary | Tree | - 

## Stack
- Real world example : Plate washing and using
- LIFO - Last in First Out
- push and pop
- Used in undo and redo operations
- [Refer](https://github.com/Dhamu785/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/02%20Stack/01_stack.py) the python script on GitHub.

## Queue
- Real world examples : Standing in a que.
- FIFO - First in First Out
- Adding elements is called enqueue.
- Removing elements is called dequeue.
- Used in linear operations
	- Uploading images
	- Printing documents
- [Refer](https://github.com/Dhamu785/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/03%20Queue/01_que.py) the python script on GitHub.
### Priority Queue
- Real world examples : queue in a hospital.
- Highest value low priority or Highest value high priority.
- First sort the list then proceed.

## Linked List 
- Real work example : Treasure hunt game, relay running.
### Pros
- Dynamic
- It is used to implement stack, queue and graphs.
### Cons
- Requires more memory.
- Cannot be accessed randomly.
### Types
- Singly linked list
- Double linked list
- Circular linked list
### Singly linked list
- Each node has single reference of another node.
