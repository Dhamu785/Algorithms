## Types of data structures
Builtin | User defined 1 | USer defined 2 
:---:|:---:|:-----:
List | Linked list | Queue
Tuple | Tree | 
Set | Graph | 
Dictionary | Stack 

## Stack
- LIFO - Last in First Out
- push and pop
- Used in undo and redo operations
- [Refer](https://github.com/Dhamu785/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/02%20Stack/01_stack.py) the python script on GitHub.

## Queue
- FIFO - First in First Out
- Adding elements is called enqueue.
- Removing elements is called dequeue.
- Used in linear operations
	- Uploading images
	- Printing documents
- [Refer](https://github.com/Dhamu785/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/03%20Queue/01_que.py) the python script on GitHub.
### Priority Queue
- Highest value low priority or Highest value high priority.
- First sort the list then proceed.
